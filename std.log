        str += " World";
        str.trim();
        System.out.println(str.length());
    }
}
```
a) 10
b) 11
c) 12
d) 13

Correct answer: b) 11

Explanation: The `str.trim()` method returns a new string with leading and trailing white spaces removed, but it is not assigned back to the `str` variable. Therefore, the length of the original string "Hello World" is printed, which is 11.

2023-10-11 13:29:42,750 - InterviewDataProcessor - INFO - Generated Questions for Java: 1. What is the output of the following Java code snippet?

```java
public class MyClass {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      String str = "Java is a widely used programming language";
      System.out.println(str.substring(10, 15));
   }
}
```
a) "Java"
b) "widely"
c) "used"
d) "program"

Correct answer: b) "widely"

Explanation: The `substring` method in Java returns a new string that is a substring of the original string. In the given code snippet, `substring(10, 15)` extracts characters from index 10 to index 15 (exclusive), which corresponds to the substring "widely".

2. Which of the following statements is true regarding Java interfaces?

a) Interfaces can contain instance variables.
b) An interface can extend multiple interfaces.
c) Concrete methods can be defined in an interface.
d) Interfaces can only be implemented, not extended.

Correct answer: b) An interface can extend multiple interfaces.

Explanation: In Java, an interface can extend multiple interfaces using the `extends` keyword. This allows for creating complex hierarchies of interfaces. However, a class can only extend a single class.

3. What is the purpose of the `transient` keyword in Java?

a) It makes a variable immutable.
b) It prevents a variable from being serialized.
c) It allows a variable to be accessed outside the class.
d) It ensures thread safety for a variable.

Correct answer: b) It prevents a variable from being serialized.

Explanation: In Java, the `transient` keyword can be used to indicate that a variable should not be serialized during object serialization. This is useful when certain variables should not be persisted or transmitted.

4. Consider the following code snippet:

```java
public class MyClass {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
      int sum = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
         sum += arr[i];
      }
      System.out.println(sum);
   }
}
```

What will be the output when the above code is executed?

a) 10
b) 15
c) 14
d) 5

Correct answer: b) 15

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all elements in the `arr` array using a for loop. The sum is initialized to 0 and then each element of the array is added to the sum. The final value of `sum` is printed, which is 15.

5. Which of the following methods is used to compare the content of two objects for equality in Java?

a) `equals()`
b) `compareTo()`
c) `contains()`
d) `replace()`
